# hands-on-ddd

Reimplementation of the code from the book: "Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core" by Alexey Zimarev.

## Description

This project is a reimplemented version of the code examples provided in the book "Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core." The aim is to present an alternative coding style while adhering to the principles and concepts of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) using .NET Core.

## Motivation

While reading the original book, "Hands-On Domain-Driven Design with .NET Core," I found that the code examples didn't resonate with my preferred coding style. To better understand and internalize the concepts of DDD, I decided to undertake this project to provide an alternative implementation that aligns with my personal coding style.

## Features

- Reimplementation of the DDD concepts discussed in the book.
- Utilizes .NET Core framework.
- Follows best practices and design patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core SDK (version x.x.x)
- [Optional] Visual Studio, Rider, or any preferred code editor

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anras573/hands-on-ddd.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```bash
cd hands-on-ddd
```

3. Restore the dependencies:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

4. Build the solution:

```bash
dotnet build --no-restore
```

### Usage

1. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
2. Explore the reimplemented codebase and compare it with the original book's examples.
3. Run the application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Interact with the application to see that it should still behave the same.
